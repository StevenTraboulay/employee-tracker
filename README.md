![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-None-blue.svg)

## Description

this is a broken piece of code for an employee directory and is impossbile to fix currently because UofT has provided all instructors, TAs and Tutors broken code that doesnt work so UofTs resources cant even provide help. so its a busted piece of junk that SHOULD provide the user the ability to update and modify an employee database. but it doesnt because once again UofT is terrible at caring for students
